# Thoughts on Oppenheimer

Oppenheimer was definitely a surprise. I was not really sure what I was getting into as I took my seat in the movie theater, but a masterpiece giving us insight into the life of Robert J. Oppenheimer was a giant treat, to say the least.

We begin the movie with Oppenheimer in his university days (definitely inspirational from my end). His lack of interest, or should I say, his inability to do experimental work was something I could relate to. Though what precedes that scene was not something I would condone. Anyway, this sequence tells us that his interest in quantum theory leads him to Europe as there has yet to exist a department for this in the United States (that is before he founded it, of course). Christopher Nolan’s visual representation of quantum particles and wave theory was a very interesting choice. Using a sort of firework imagery to give off the illusion of undergoing a chain reaction was definitely pretty. I did very much enjoy the use of rain droplets as an illustration as well, reminding us that although eventually this will lead to a bomb, it draws on the fundamental and natural ways of our world. As a physics student myself, it was entertaining seeing the fascination with the world of quantum mechanics, when it is something I learned about in a regular lecture along with old ideas like Newton.

Of course, this is not a purely physics movie. Though much time is spent in the physics room talking about protons smashing into uranium and how the setting off the nuclear bomb could lead to the destruction of the atmosphere and the world, it is not the point of the movie. Nolan’s intention was clearly to demonstrate Oppenheimer’s complicated and interesting connections to both the physics and political world at the time. The second half of the movie deals with this political aspect, focusing more on Strauss, who is determined to bring Oppenheimer down for reasons that seem very shallow. He believes Oppenheimer had turned all the scientists against him, from a small interaction between the two and Albert Einstein. I do realize not many people enjoyed this part of the movie, however, upon my second watch, I came to appreciate it more. The cathartic ending of seeing Oppenheimer, perhaps, repent for his sins, as well as Strauss not getting what he wants, was quite satisfying.

Now, I want to speak on the feminism in this movie. Perhaps I would not speak of it if it had not been released at the same time as Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie”. But alas, I believe this movie is feminist. Or at least as feminist as it could be considering the setting. I appreciate Nolan’s subtle commentary on the gender divide in the science community back then, hinting at some of the backlash women faced when attempting to work on important scientific developments. Of course, the famous picture of Oppenheimer below was taken in the scene where a female scientist is being turned away as they are unsure of how radiation could affect the female reproductive system, to which she responds with how the male reproductive system is “more exposed”. Another unexpected moment of feminism was when a female scientist complained that she had been asked if she can type, and Oppenheimer proceeded to assign her to the chemistry section of the Manhattan Project. We also cannot forget Kitty’s character, a biologist stuck in the housewife role. Her interrogation scene alone was so badass and well-written, I could not help but label this movie as feminist.

The least surprising part of the movie, I would say, is the technicalities and just how well and beautifully made it is. Nolan has proven again that he is one step ahead of the curve in filmmaking. The use of color to differentiate between Oppenheimer and Strauss’ POVs was incredibly smart and helped to put together the scenes, even when they were jumbled. And the explosion itself, Nolan’s refusal to use CGI was both a blessing and maybe a small mistake. I will not hesitate to say that the trinity test scene was shot magnificently. The moment of silence after, with just Oppenheimer’s breathing (and my boyfriend’s beside me), made my heart rate spike and my palms sweaty. Yet, I have seen many people online complain about the use of a real explosion, as it did not emulate the sheer impact of a nuclear bomb. It was missing that oomph, or maybe the mushroom cloud itself. I understand this criticism and do agree with it to some extent. But I still believe the sheer beauty of the explosion itself is worth the lack of CGI. Overall, the conflicting feelings that scene alone brings perhaps carry the movie. We are celebrating the creation of a monstrosity, but why am I filled with satisfaction? “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”
